The goal is to navigate a character vertically up a tower that is filling with water and barricaded with a series of floors. The player will feel trapped, frantic, and pressured. Idling players will be punished when the floors fall and break underneath them. Don’t make a mistake. Don’t drown.
The player will be able to aim and shoot to break through the floors, jump to the next level, and hopefully escape the water. Your shots are limited, so be strategic, and plan a path to pick up more ammo.
The style will be geometric and minimalist. We will focus on creating an environment that has absolute visual clarity.
